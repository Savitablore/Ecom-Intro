Hi, 

I hope you're doing well. My name is Mayur Dudhe, and I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have also completed a 9-month internship at BIOCLUTCH SCIENTIFIC PRIVATE LIMITED as a Database Engineer Intern, where I gained hands-on experience in managing and optimizing databases.

I am reaching out to inquire if there are any openings for freshers for the Data Engineer position focused on Big Data in your organization. With my academic background and internship experience in Big Data technologies, I am confident that I can contribute positively to your team.

Please let me know if there are any suitable opportunities. You can contact me at mayurdudhe111@gmail.com or 9922417719.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Mayur Dudhe
